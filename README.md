# Vanilla JS Calculator

A fully functional calculator application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in DOM manipulation, input validation, user experience handling, and incremental feature development without using any external libraries or frameworks.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Vanilla JS Calculator performs basic arithmetic operations with a focus on **robust input handling**, **clear user feedback**, and **clean separation of concerns**.  
It was built to simulate how even small tools should handle edge cases and user interaction gracefully.

## ✨ Features

- Two numeric input fields
- Supported operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Clear / reset functionality
- **Keyboard input support**
  - `+  -  *  /` for operations
  - `Enter` to calculate
  - `Esc` to reset
- **Input validation with inline error messages**
- **Explicit divide-by-zero handling**
- **Formatted calculation results** (rounded decimals)
- **Visual feedback on button interactions**
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure and inputs
- **CSS3** – layout, responsive design, and interaction feedback
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – logic, DOM manipulation, validation, and event handling
